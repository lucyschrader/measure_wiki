Editing Wikidata improves the data backbone of Wikipedia, and the many other sites and services that use it.

Adding new items is often a first step towards creating an article, and fills a gap in the knowledge available. Editing an item to add new claims makes it richer and more connected with the rest of the knowledge web.

Changing an item's claims or removing incorrect or unsourced ones are other great ways of making the whole system better.
