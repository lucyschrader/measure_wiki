Contributing to Wikipedia makes information significantly more accessible. As well as creating new articles, people can improve existing ones in small and large ways.

Adding references makes an article more reliable and trustworthy, and provides others with more sources to learn from. Adding images makes articles more engaging, and infoboxes get across the essential info at a glance.
